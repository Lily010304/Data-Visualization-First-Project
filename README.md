# Introduction:
Getting to our destination with the minimum delay is one of the most important goals when it comes to traveling.


In this project I will create visualizations to reveal insights from the flight delays data set. I will create data visualizations that tell a story and highlight patterns in the flight delays data set.
### About Dataset:
Dataset can be found here.
The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations.


The flight delay and cancellation data was collected and published by the DOT's Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
The dataset has 3 files, flights.csv, airlines.csv, and airports.csv.
